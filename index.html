<H1> TOP 10 SERIES/MOVIES ON NETFLIX IN MY OPINION	</H1>  
	 <H2> 1.MANIFEST </H2> 
<H3> Year: 2022
Creator: Jeff Rake
Stars: Josh Dallas, Melissa Roxburgh, Athena Karkanis, J.R. Ramirez, Luna Blaise, Jack Messina,
Ty Doran, Parveen Kaur, Matt Long, Holly Taylor, Daryl Edwards
Genre: Sci-fi, Drama
	Rating: TV-14 </H3>
<H4>The men and women of Manifest technically don’t leave Earth’s atmosphere, but the series, which ran on NBC for three seasons
before being axed and eventually saved by Netflix, is a mysterious sci-fi drama worth your time. The show follows the crew and passengers of
Montego Air Flight 828, which lands safely in New York after experiencing turbulence en route from Jamaica. However, they soon find out that
in the few hours they were in flight, the rest of the world aged five-and-a-half years, allowing friends and family members to mourn them and
move on with their lives (as best as they can, anyway). While some might say the passengers have been given a second chance, others believe they’re
meant for something greater than they ever thought possible. —Kaitlin Thomas.The men and women of Manifest technically don’t leave

	 <H5> 2. LOVE IS BLIND 3 </H5>
<H6> Year: 2022
Creator: Chris Coelen
Stars: Nick Lachey, Vanessa Lachey
Genre: Dating Reality
	Rating: TV-MA </H6>
<H7>“How do you spell Cole? So not like the ‘coal’ like Santa?” “This is a deal breaker. Do you like the Jonas Brothers?” And with those two
 absurd quotes from two different singles, I was hooked on yet another season of Love Is Blind, a reality relationship series that 
takes the word “cringe” to an entirely new level. The Nick and Vanessa Lachey-hosted Netflix series is back for a third season, this time set
in Dallas, and it’s crazier than ever. While the formula remains the same (chat via pods for 10 days, propose, meet your fiancé, get married 
four weeks later, drink from golden goblets) the players have all changed—and what an oddball group of characters they are. —Terry Terrones</H7>
