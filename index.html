	 1.MANIFEST 
 TOP 10 SERIES/MOVIES ON NETFLIX IN MY OPINION 
Year: 2022
Creator: Jeff Rake
Stars: Josh Dallas, Melissa Roxburgh, Athena Karkanis, J.R. Ramirez, Luna Blaise, Jack Messina,
Ty Doran, Parveen Kaur, Matt Long, Holly Taylor, Daryl Edwards
Genre: Sci-fi, Drama
Rating: TV-14The men and women of Manifest technically don’t leave Earth’s atmosphere, but the series, which ran on NBC for three seasons
before being axed and eventually saved by Netflix, is a mysterious sci-fi drama worth your time. The show follows the crew and passengers of
Montego Air Flight 828, which lands safely in New York after experiencing turbulence en route from Jamaica. However, they soon find out that
in the few hours they were in flight, the rest of the world aged five-and-a-half years, allowing friends and family members to mourn them and
move on with their lives (as best as they can, anyway). While some might say the passengers have been given a second chance, others believe they’re
meant for something greater than they ever thought possible. —Kaitlin Thomas.The men and women of Manifest technically don’t leave
